			<h2 epub:type="title">Bruin and Reynard Partners</h2>
			<p>Once on a time Bruin and Reynard were to own a field in common. They had a little clearing up in the wood, and the first year they sowed rye.</p>
			<p>“Now we must share the crop as is fair and right,” said Reynard. “If you like to have the root, I’ll take the top.”</p>
			<p>Yes, Bruin was ready to do that; but when they had threshed out the crop, Reynard got all the corn, but Bruin got nothing but roots and rubbish. He did not like that at all; but Reynard said it was how they had agreed to share it.</p>
			<p>“This year I have the gain,” said Reynard; “next year it will be your turn. Then you shall have the top, and I shall have to put up with the root.”</p>
			<p>But when spring came, and it was time to sow, Reynard asked Bruin what he thought of turnips.</p>
			<p>“Aye, aye!” said Bruin, “that’s better food than corn;” and so Reynard thought also. But when harvest came Reynard got the roots, while Bruin got the turnip-tops. And then Bruin was so angry with Reynard that he put an end at once to his partnership with him.</p>
