			<h3 epub:type="title">How to Win a Prince</h3>
			<p>Once on a time there was a king’s son who made love to a lass, but after they had become great friends and were as good as betrothed, the prince began to think little of her, and he got it into his head that she wasn’t clever enough for him, and so he wouldn’t have her.</p>
			<p>So he thought how he might be rid of her; and at last he said he would take her to wife all the same, if she could come to him⁠—</p>

					<br/>

					<span>Not fasting,</span>

			<p>And all this happened in the twilight, betwixt night and day.</p>
			<p>So when she came to the guard at the palace, she begged that she might have leave to speak with the prince; but they wouldn’t open the gate, she looked such a figure of fun.</p>
			<p>But for all that the noise woke up the prince, and he went to the window to see what it was.</p>
			<p>So she waddled up to the window, and twisted off one of the ram’s horns, and took it and rapped with it against the window.</p>
			<p>And so they had to let her in, and have her for their princess.</p>
