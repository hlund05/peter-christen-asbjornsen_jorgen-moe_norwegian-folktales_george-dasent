			<h2>THE HARE AND THE HEIRESS.</h2>
			<p>Once on a time there was a hare, who was frisking up and down under the greenwood tree.</p>
			<p>'Oh! hurrah! hip, hip, hurrah!' he cried, and leapt and sprang, and all at once he threw a somersault, and stood upon his hind legs. Just then a fox came slouching by.</p>
			<p>'Good-day, good-day,' said the hare; 'I'm so merry to-day, for you must know I was married this morning.'</p>
			<p>'Lucky fellow you,' said the fox.</p>
			<p>'Ah, no! not so lucky after all,' said the hare, 'for she was very heavy handed, and it was an old witch I got to wife.</p>
			<p>'Then you were an unlucky fellow,' said the fox.</p>
			<p>'Oh, not so unlucky either,' said the hare, 'for she was an heiress. She had a cottage of her own.'</p>
			<p>'Then you were lucky after all,' said the fox.</p>
			<p>'No, no! not so lucky either,' said the hare, 'for the cottage caught fire and was burnt, and all we had with it.'</p>
			<p>'That I call downright unlucky,' said the fox.</p>
			<p>'Oh, no; not so very unlucky after all,' said the hare, 'for my witch of a wife was burnt along with her cottage.'</p>
